# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program for a client to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.

## Results
For the kitchen review that we selected, the results show like the following:

Paid Reviews

1207 total paid reviews.
with 509 total of paid five start reviews,
giving a percentage of 42%.
Unpaid Reviews

97839 total paid reviews.
with 45858 total of paid five start reviews,
giving a percentage of about 47%.

## Summary
42% of the reviews in the Vine program were 5 stars reviews whereas the percentage in the non-Vine reviews is only 47%.
Also, the total review in the unpaid vine program were more important that the paid program.
That's to say, and as per the percentage calculated, we can conclude that analysis the vine program does not show any big bias.
Additionally we could analyse the statistical distribution (mean, median and mode) of the star rating for the Vine and non-Vine reviews.
